# React Notes App

Welcome to the React Notes App! üöÄ This application is a fantastic starting point, and we want to extend a special thanks to Scrimba and the incredible Bob Ziroll for their guidance and inspiration. üôå

## Getting Started

To run the app locally, follow these steps:

1.  Clone the repository to your local machine:

    bashCopy code

    `git clone https://github.com/your-username/react-notes-app.git`

2.  Navigate to the project directory:

    bashCopy code

    `cd react-notes-app`

3.  Install dependencies:

    bashCopy code

    `npm install`

4.  Start the development server:

    bashCopy code

    `npm start`

    This will open the app in your default web browser.

## Features to Add

### 1. Sync Notes with localStorage

Sync notes with `localStorage` so that user notes persist even if they close and reopen the app. This ensures a seamless user experience.

### 2. Add Note Summaries to Titles

Enhance the user experience by adding note summaries to titles. This can provide a quick overview of the note content in the notes list.

### 3. Move Modified Notes to the Top

Implement a feature to move modified or recently edited notes to the top of the notes list. This helps users quickly identify and access their most recent notes.

### 4. Ability to Delete Notes

Allow users to delete unwanted or irrelevant notes. Implement a feature that enables users to remove notes from the app.

### 5. Save Markdown Files on Firebase DB

Transform the app into a markdown editor and enable users to save their markdown notes on Firebase Database. This can involve creating a backend service to handle storage and retrieval of markdown files.
